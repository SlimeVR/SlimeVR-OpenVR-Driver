# SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver
SlimeVR driver for OpenVR. Used to communicate between the SlimeVR server and SteamVR.

## How to get

It's recommended to install the driver via the SlimeVR installer here: https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Installer/releases/latest/download/slimevr_web_installer.exe

Alternatively, you can also manually install it by following one of the two methods below.

### Option one

Downloaded the latest release here: https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver/releases/latest/download/slimevr-openvr-driver-win64.zip.
Copy the `slimevr` folder in your SteamVR folder, usually it's located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers`. This should look like this:

### Building

Clone the repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver` to clone with all libraries and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) registry.

To build the project with VSCode on Windows you need to install [VS Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg binary `.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` or `./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh`.

After installing vcpkg if you're on Windows, you need to run `vcpkg integrate install` command from the vcpkg folder to integrate it for VSCode.

For other systems and IDEs instructions are not available as of now, contributions are welcome.

### Updating vcpkg packages

To update vcpkg packages set the vcpkg registry submodule to a newer commit and rerun the bootstrap script.
