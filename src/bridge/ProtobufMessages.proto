 Tracker designations clarifications

 tracker_id field contains internal tracker id of a tracker on the SENDING side. Recieving
 side can have their own ids, names, serials, etc. If two sides exchange tracker information
 in both ways, they're allowed to reuse tracker ids for the trackers they create themselves.

 tracker_name is user-readable descriptive name of a tracker, it is allowed to be non-unique.

 tracker_serial is unique identificator of a tracker on the sender side, can be used to remap
 trackers from one id to another during reconnect or session restart, or to save persistent
 data or configuration between sessions
