/**
 * @brief Client implementation for communication with SlimeVR Server using pipes or unix sockets.
 * 
 * This class provides a set of methods to start, stop an IO thread, send messages over a named pipe or unix socket
 * and is abstracted through `libuv`.
 * 
 * When a message is received and parsed from the pipe, the messageCallback function passed in the constructor is called
 * from the event loop thread with the message as a parameter.
 * 
 * @param logger A shared pointer to an Logger object to log messages from the transport.
 * @param on_message_received A function to be called from event loop thread when a message is received and parsed from the pipe.
